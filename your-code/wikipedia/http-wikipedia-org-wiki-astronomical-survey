Composite image of the GOODS-South field, result of a deep survey using two of the four giant 8.2-metre telescopes composing ESO's Very Large Telescope  Gamma-ray pulsars detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope An astronomical survey is a general map or image of a region of the sky (or of the whole sky) that lacks a specific observational target.  Alternatively, an astronomical survey may comprise a set of images, spectra, or other observations of objects that share a common type or feature. Surveys are often restricted to one band of the electromagnetic spectrum due to instrumental limitations, although multiwavelength surveys can be made by using multiple detectors, each sensitive to a different bandwidth.[1] Surveys have generally been performed as part of the production of an astronomical catalog. They may also search for transient astronomical events. They often use wide-field astrographs.  Contents  1 Scientific value 2 List of sky surveys  2.1 Surveys of the Magellanic Clouds   3 See also 4 References   Scientific value[edit] Sky surveys, unlike targeted observation of a specific object, allow astronomers to catalog celestial objects and perform statistical analyses on them without complex corrections for selection effects.  In some cases, an astronomer interested in a particular object will find that survey images are sufficient to make new telescope time entirely unnecessary. Surveys also help astronomers choose targets for closer study using larger, more powerful telescopes. If previous observations support a hypothesis, a telescope scheduling committee is more likely to approve new, more detailed observations to test it. The wide scope of surveys makes them ideal for finding foreground objects that move, such as asteroids and comets. An astronomer can compare existing survey images to current observations to identify changes; this task can even be performed automatically using image analysis software. Besides science, these surveys also detect potentially hazardous objects. Similarly, images of the same object taken by different surveys can be compared to detect transient astronomical events such as variable stars.[2]  List of sky surveys[edit]  Spectrum of types of observations of Solar System objects.  The positions in space of just some of the galaxies identified by the VIPERS survey (see Visible Multi Object Spectrograph).[3] See also: Category:Astronomical surveys Optical Hipparchus - created the first known star catalogue with more than 850 stars.
